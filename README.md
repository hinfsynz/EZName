# EZName
Create an easy-to-pronunce and meaningful name from chinese ancient poems for newborns

## Introduction
This project is inspired by another name-creating project "ReName" (https://github.com/repoog/ReName)

The main features of this program include

* Generate a name according to the expected date of birth or a specific hour of the mom's due date. If only the date is provided, the program will generate up to N names for each hour of that day. N is a user-defined parameter.
* The names are picked up from different collections of poems based on the baby's gender. For instance, if it's a boy, the default dictionary is <<chuci>>; if it's a girl, the default source is <<shijing>>
* The candidate names are all easy to pronounce for English speakers because these names' pinyin syllables have low level of difficulty for pronunciation.
* The users can download Sogou cell thesaurus (*.scel) and load them in the program to use as the source of names 
* Optionally, the users can decide if the names need to be scored by its "天格/地格/人格/才格". And if they choose to do so, the candidate names will be given in an descending order of this score.
